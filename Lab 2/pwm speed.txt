We have a period of 100,000 Hertz

We increment pwm_counter each pulse

We increment cycle_counter each 1000 pulses


We turn on LED when current_counter > pwm_counter
We keep the LED off otherwise

current_cycle resets after 200 pulses


2000*(100,000 Hertz)*200

20 000

The PWM takes 4 seconds to operate
